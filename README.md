# Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project I was asked to explore the US Bikeshare data using python with certain libraries. I was asked to create code so that I could provide statistics about bikeshare data regarding 3 major cities.

### Required Software
* I used Python 3, NumPy, and pandas while using Anaconda
* A text editor: VSC
* A terminal application: Git Bash.

### Files used
1. The following file contains all the python code:
   * bikeshare.py	
2. The following files are not uploaded using **gitignore** as they are too big:
   * chicago.csv
   * new_york_city.csv
   * washington.csv

### Extra
* For questions and concerns I mainly used the integrated ChatGPT
